"""
rag_search.py - Document-based fallback module for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This module is responsible for searching document embeddings from a vector store (e.g., FAISS).
It's used as a mid-layer fallback when RASA fails and user queries may be answered via uploaded docs.

âœ… Uses Langchain
âœ… Supports HuggingFace embeddings
âœ… Search top-3 semantically similar chunks
